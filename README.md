# Turnit Test assingment | August 2024
This is a test assignment made for Turnit in August 2024.

# TL;DR
The objective of the assignment is to create a program which finds a common time interval from given time intervals where the greatest amount of bus drivers are taking a break (given a set of times e.g. 11:20-13:30) when someone is resting.
This is a sweep line algorithm problem.

# Usage
This program can be used in two ways - with an input file or without it.

## Example usage with input file, and of the input file itself:

As seen, the test files follow a hh:mmhh:mm\n format, as per the assignment spec.

## Example usage without an input file:

Here, no input file is selected, and instead times are entered manually. The calculations are ran seperately each time.

# How to run
You can compile the code yourself or grab the win-x64 exe file from the Releases section under this repo. Your antivirus will probably get angry with you because it isn't signed or anything, but if you don't trust me feel free to build it yourself.
